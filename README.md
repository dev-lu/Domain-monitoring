# Domain monitoring
Monitor new registered DNS domains by keywords. This is useful to find domains similar to your companys domains, registered by malicious actors like phishers and spammers. This way it is possible to block and abuse these domains before they are used for a phishing campaign. Newest domains are shown on the top. Additionally you can see the http status code and some further information for every domain.
